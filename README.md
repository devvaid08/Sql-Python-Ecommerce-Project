# Sql-Python-Ecommerce-Project

Hi, my name is Dev Vaid.
Here is my eCommerce project.

E-commerce Backend Project
Tools: Python, SQL, Jupyter Notebook

Developed a basic e-commerce backend system to simulate product listings, user management, and order processing.

Utilized SQL for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, integrating it with Python through libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Created visualizations and reports using Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate sales trends and customer behavior.

Applied real-world data handling techniques, including data cleaning, querying, and basic analytics.
